# Project React+ Mantine.core  

## Overview

This project leverages the power of React, TypeScript, and Mantine Core UI to create a variety of interactive and user-friendly components. The main components developed in this project include server-side and client-side tables with pagination, as well as various controlled inputs such as AutoSelect, DatePicker, Simple Input, MultiSelect Input, and DateRangePicker.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- **Mantine Core UI**: A React components library with a focus on usability and performance.

## Components

1. **Server-Side Table with Pagination**
   - Handles data fetching from a server.
   - Implements pagination to efficiently manage large data sets.
   
2. **Client-Side Table with Pagination**
   - Manages data locally.
   - Implements pagination for better user experience and data management.

This ReadMe provides an overview of the project, detailing the technologies used, components created, and steps for installation and usage. Contributions and licensing information are also included for those interested in collaborating or understanding the legalities of using this code.
Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
